title: About
---
I am a UBC student working towards my bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics. My interests lie in technology, and how it can play a role in advancing sustainability. I also love creating ‚Äî websites, pants, blog posts, knit toques, and a solar car are just some examples.

I am currently working as a chassis controls intern at Tesla.

I was recently a teaching assistant at UBC for a computer engineering course on software construction in Java (CPEN221).

My last co-op was at Kardium as an automation engineering co-op student. I helped develop software and build jigs that automate the fabrication of medical devices for atrial fibrillation. ‚ù§Ô∏è

During the summer of 2020, I was a research co-op student with The Quantum Matter Institute at UBC. This included writing MATLAB code to analyse data, and designing new components for machines with SolidWorks. ‚öõÔ∏è

For my first co-op at Ausenco, I designed interactive dashboards with Power BI and created an online catalog of engineering standards. I have also helped kids with math and reading at Kumon.

Outside of class, you can find me designing a solar car chassis with UBC Solar ‚òÄÔ∏è or learning to code by building projects such as Round Recipes. Finally, here is my most popular writing piece: [The Art Of Not Thinking](./not-thinking).
