*TLDR: Engineering Physics student at UBC with experience in software construction, machine learning, drones, and electric cars*

🌸🌻🌸🌻🌸🌻🌸🌻🌸🌻🌸

I am currently studying Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada. Throughout this bachelor's degree, I have had the opportunity to work on cool projects with companies and research labs.

My interests lie in technology and sustainability. I also love creating — designing websites, knitting bucket hats, sewing pants, and baking chocolate desserts are just some examples.

## Experience

🤖 My most recent internship was with the Tesla Bot team where I worked on cool ways to make the robot plan and navigate its surroundings.

🧠 In 2023, I was in the UK working on drones in simulation with reinforcement learning.

🏎️ In 2022, I worked with software in the chassis controls team at Tesla.

🖥️ I was a teaching assistant at UBC for a computer engineering course on software construction in Java (CPEN221).

❤️ In 2021, I interned at Kardium in the automation team. I helped develop software and build jigs that automate the fabrication of medical devices for atrial fibrillation.

⚛️ During the summer of 2020, I was a research co-op student with The Quantum Matter Institute at UBC. This included writing MATLAB code to analyse data, and designing new components for machines with SolidWorks.

📏 For my first co-op at Ausenco, I designed interactive dashboards with Power BI and created an online catalog of engineering standards. This first sparked my interest in code!

🔢 In high school, I held my very first job helping kids with math and reading at Kumon.

## Extra

I wrote this article [The Art Of Not Thinking](./not-thinking) which somehow hit the top of HN.
