I am currently

- learning chess through Lichess puzzles,
- optimizing drone formations with Julia,
- watching way too many videos on [epoxy table making](https://www.youtube.com/@BlacktailStudio) and [huge construction projects](https://www.youtube.com/@TheB1M),
- trying not to read the Stormlight Archive in one sitting,
- climbing at the UBC Aviary until my knee gives out.
