When I was younger, I was a very anxious kid. I disliked any situation that tested my abilities and challenged my weaknesses (with the exception of school). The constant feeling of being judged, the fear of making one mistake, was debilitating.

I was also terrified to meet new people. I was scared of not knowing what they thought, not knowing how they were like. This fear overwhelmed my thoughts, until I couldn't think calmly, which aggravated the situation further because now I was also anxious that I couldn't talk with them normally.

I became so anxious that I started worrying about my future as well. If I couldn't meet new people, how could I do a job interview, which was a combination of being judged and meeting someone new? How could I make friends in new schools? I searched far and wide on the world wide web, and read all the tips and tricks possible.

"Pose like a superhero beforehand."

"Recall good experiences."

"Take big deep breaths."

"Expose yourself to uncomfortable situations."

I tried to implement every piece of advice. I power posed. I recalled good memories. I tried to calm down. I tried new things. And nothing seemed to work. I was still as anxious as I was yesterday. So I would give up and accept the fact that I would be very anxious and uncomfortable for the rest of my life.

Forward to a few months later, my frustration at myself would compel me to try again. And so I did. But this time without the expectation that I would immediately be comfortable and talkative. This time, **I accepted that I would be anxious and uncomfortable**. Instead of trying to improve every single aspect, I focused on implementing one tip at a time. It could be remembering someone's name (so I didn't have to worry about not being able to recall it later on), walking calmly (instead of an anxious speed walk), or posing like a superhero (to increase the power hormone testosterone).

I also started trying new uncomfortable things, like working at a fast-food restaurant where I had to talk to customers and work well under pressure, volunteering in leadership roles, and talking with more people. We grow from escaping our boundaries.

Now, I have been on a few interviews where I felt good to show them what I could do. I have been in classes where I was comfortable asking questions among 300+ students. On my first day at university, I made a good friend from a random stranger sitting in the cafeteria. I'm not an anxious person[^1] anymore; **I'm just someone who sometimes feels anxious**.

I'm still not completely at ease in new situations, but [I'm OK with that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGyVTAoXEU). No matter how much you wish to be instantaneously transformed overnight, reducing anxiety takes time. Unless you find a way to time travel, you canâ€™t speed up the process.

But you can choose when to leave the starting line.
